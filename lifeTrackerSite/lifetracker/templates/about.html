	LifeTracker is an application to help you better understand all the events in your life.

	<br /> <br />

	On average, how much time do you spend exercising per day? How much of your time is spent sleeping? How much of your time do you spend doing things that don't matter?

	<br /> <br />

	LifeTracker was specifically designed to help solve these problems.

	Mike is an average college student. He is cool with the guys, and generally gets good grades. But recently, his grades have been slipping a little bit. What happened?

	Steve has been very sad lately. He thinks it's because of his sleep schedule, but he's not really sure.

	<br /> <br />

	So Steve creates an account at LifeTracker. He records the time he goes to bed each night, and the time he wakes up each morning. And everyday he reccords his mood.

	<br /> <br />

	After a few weeks of reccording, he discovers the following relationship:

	<br /> <br />

	Steve now knows that he is on average in the best mood when he sleeps 8ish hours. Itâ€™s also
interesting to note that he feels a lot better after 3 hours of sleep compared to 4 hours of
sleep.

<br /> <br />

	Steve can sleep peacefully again.
